# 4. Item Counter
# Assume that a file containing a series of names (as strings) is named
# names.txt and exists on the computerâ€™s disk. Write a program that displays
# the number of names that are stored in the file.
# (Hint: Open the file and read every string stored in it. Use a variable to keep a
# count of the number of items that are read from the file.)
